Description:  User Story - AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

Acceptance Criteria - GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

Installation: First delete sample index.html.  Install by navigating to root folder in terminal, then running node index.js in terminal in order to begin prompt questions.  Once complete, this will create an index.html file that can be launched in browser or live server.

Usage: Once launched, a user can navigate thru terminal questions for one manager and unlimited Interns and Engineers.  This will add cards for each individual team member to our web page with information about each user - name, id, office number for manager...name, id, school for intern...and name, id, and github user name for engineer.  Email and Github user name will be live links to open default email app or link to github.


License: No licenses were used

Contributing: Peter Bookmyer - Developer with the help of TAs and Tutor, Rebecca.  Classmates (Ted, Kris, Nate, Luke) were also helpful in completing this application.

Tests: Jest tests were preformed on each of the methods associated with my 4 classes.  All pass accordingly.
